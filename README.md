# Belly_Button_Biodiversity


## **Overview**

The objective of this project was to build an interactive web-based bashboard that explores the Belly Button Diversity Dataset, which catalogs the microbes residing in human navels.

The dashboard consists of the following:
* A dropdown menu to alternate between the data off each individual included in the dataset.
* Bar chart depicting the top ten bacterial species.
* Bubble chart depicting all bacterial species.
* Guage that depicts the number of weekly washes for each individual.
